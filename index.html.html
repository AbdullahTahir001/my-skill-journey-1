My name is <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/abdullahtahirsportfolio/home">ABDULLAH Tahir<a>. I'm a <font color="blue">DIGITAL MARKETER.</font> I'm 20 years old college dropout with big dreams in heart. I started B.com IT for learning business. But with the end of 1st year in college I found out its a bullshit. They are teaching nothing to us and the syllabus is 50 years old with no meaning. At that time I have realized to leave the college and decided to change something. To bring Revolutionary Innovation. </p></font>
